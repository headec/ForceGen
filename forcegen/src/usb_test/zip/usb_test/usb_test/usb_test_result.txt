Steps to reproduce the error:
    1. initiate the Force Dimension device either with DRD or DHD (or the bin file, ust_test, if applicable)
    2. once started, unplug
    3. repeat
Each step will be considered as a trial.
Each error will be considered as a sample.

< Result >
Regardless of the changes made to the _hid or the use of the dhd functions,
using DRD:
- when the USB is unplugged, the error still appears even with the default _hid value
- trials taken to reproduce the error: 1, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8, 10, 10, 13, 34
using DHD:
- Not a single error occurred out of 100 trials
